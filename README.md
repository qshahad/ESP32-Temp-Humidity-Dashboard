## 🔍 Overview

This project showcases a real-time IoT dashboard using the ESP32 microcontroller. It:

- Reads data from a **DHT11** temperature and humidity sensor  
- Hosts a **local web server** to display live sensor data  
- Visualizes readings with **dynamic charts** powered by Chart.js  
- Uses **LED indicators** to reflect environmental conditions
